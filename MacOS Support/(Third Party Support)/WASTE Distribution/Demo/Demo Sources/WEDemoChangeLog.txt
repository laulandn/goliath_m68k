2.1a3 --> 2.1a420010925:	Command-key combos for dimmed menu items were incorrectly			passed to WEKey.20011003:	TODO: Canceling the Save Changes alert doesn't work when quitting			the application.  Thanks to Richard Laws for pointing this out.20011009:	Removed uses of WEGetText and WEInsert so that demo code can be			compiled with WASTE_DEPRECATED set to 0.20011009:	SetContentsOfSelection (in WEDemoScripting.c) is now capable of			accepting Unicode text directly (without coercion).20011107:	James McCartney reports: "At the end of ProcessWindowHICommand it calls			UpdateModifiedFlag on the document, even when that document has been destroyed			by a close command. This leads to a crash."			It's late and I'm a bit sleepy, but I think I fixed this.20011114:	Removed all WASTE object handler code.  The demo now just enables the			built-in object handlers in WASTELib using WEInstallStandardObjectHandlers.			As a consequence, the demo now requires WASTE 2.1a4 or newer.20011115:	We now establish a control embedding hierarchy in all windows.			This simplifies scrollbar activation and deactivation.20011115:	The demo now takes advantage of the new weFAutoIdle feature flag, and			no longer calls WEIdle.20011115:	Tentative change to use the new WEProcessHICommand API, which is still in flux.20011211:	Changes to filing code to take advantage of new filing APIs (WESave/WELoad).			This means the WASTE Demo now handles RTF.2.1a6 --> 2.1a720020302:	In WEDemoAbout.c, we now create a root control for the about box window.20020321:	We support framework-style includes in Mach-O builds.			We now require Universal Headers 3.4.1 or newer.			We now use GetAvailableWindowAttributes to determine if the Window Manager			supports live resizing, instead of a Gestalt check.			Added check for CarbonLib version -- the WASTE Demo requires CarbonLib 1.5 or newer.			Changed several addresses in the credits (boingo.com is now boingo.org, the mailing			list that used to be hosted by rhino.harvard.edu is now hosted by letterrip.com).20020323:	Use QDSwapPort instead of GetPort/SetPort -- this makes code slightly more efficient on X.20020327:	DoMouseMoved in WEDemoApplication.c no longer handles mouse-moved events in the content			area of windows -- that's always taken care of by DoCursorChange in WEDemoWindows.c since			starting from CarbonLib 1.5, the kEventWindowCursorChange event is supported on OS 9 as			well as OS X.2.1a7 --> 2.1a820020328:	Minor changes to show off the new weFLeftMarginClick feature.20020403:	Experimental change: we no longer reset the undo stack when a document is saved			(but kept open).  Rather, we just record the current modification count into the			Document, so we can later determine whether the document is "clean" (in sync with			the on-disk version).  This means actions can still be undone/redone after a			document has been saved.20020419:	Added support for mouse wheels, contextual menus and Mac OS X Services.20020507:	Changed WriteFile() so that it has a code path that overwrites existing files directly,			rather than attempting a "safe save".  The old safe save code path is still there, but			is never taken.  There are two reasons for this change: 1. AFAIK, some volume types may not			support FSExchangeObjects() correctly, and implementing safe saves without this handy API			can be cumbersome; 2. I'm preparing the WASTE Demo to handle RTFD packages, and it's not			clear to me what it means to perform a safe save of a package.			Speaking of packages, do they support the stationery bit?  If not, they should.			To end users, document packages should appear in the Finder just like plain files.			To end users, the difference between a NeXTStep-style .rtfd package and a vanilla .rtf			file coming from Windows is far from obvious, especially if file extensions are hidden,			so they may have a hard time understanding why they can set the stationery flag on			the latter, but not on the former.20020512:	On OS X, window titles reflect the "display name" of the corresponding file, rather than			its actual name.  In other words, extensions do not appear in window titles if they're			hidden in the Finder.			Fixed a bug that prevented document windows with overlaid sheets from being moved or resized.			Rewritten printing code so that it uses sheets on OS X.20020513:	Colors in the Text Color are now represented by icons, since the item text itself cannot			be colored under OS X.
