Rather than take the performance hit *								 back, num_members is constrained to fit in a *signed* long. If it doesn't, *								 we return NULL immediately. *  27-Feb-96 JFH  Fabrizio convinced me to undo the previous change and fix the bug in a *								 different way. We basically preflight to make sure the fatal condition *								 doesn't occur. *  mm 961031      Improved legibility of function declaration*/
