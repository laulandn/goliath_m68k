DAVLib for MacOS - Change historyVersion 1.0 - Sept 7, 1999   Initial version   Version 1.1 - Sept 28, 1999   Fixed access to Sharemation Server   added CDAVRequest::GetItemProperties   fixed issue with CDAVRequest::PutResource   fixed issue with CDAVRequest copy constructor   Version 1.1.1 - Sept 29, 1999   Fixed bug in listing directorys on an Apache mod_dav server   Version 1.1.2 - Oct 10, 1999   Relicensed under GNU GPL 2.0   Version 1.5   - split authentication and server information out of CDAVRequest into a new      class named CDAVContext   - added new method - CDAVRequest::GetServerOptions and new class CDAVInfo   - fixed bug where any HTTP/DAV response over 32k was not processed properly   - added missing HTTP 1.1 feature - support for chunked transfer encoding   - changed the m_namespace of CNamespacedObject to be an actual instance of      std::string instead of a pointer; this fixes a problem with multiple     namespaces declared within a single element.  This fix allows DAVLib to      interoperate with MS IIS 5.0   Version 1.5.1   - tightened up XML parsing strictness; removed some code that erroneously dealt     with bad XML because of improper handling of the HTTP 1.1 chunked transfer      encoding.     - fixed a bug in CDAVRequest::GetResource where in some cases, the downloaded     file's length was errantly set to zero, nulling out the data.   - work with CDAVRequest::GetResource; Internet config is now used to      type the newly created files.  Also fixed a PowerPlant bug where files     are made zero length if temporary files are used in the LDynamicBuffer     class.   - fixed bug in CDAVContext where the field m_hasUserCred was not initially set     to anything in the objects constructor.     Verson 1.5.2   - Integrated version 1.1 of the Expat parser   - Removed XML Namespace code from parsexml.h/cpp; instead using     built-in XML namespace processing in latest Expat version.     Version 1.5.3   - removed extraenous CRLF CDAVConnection::SendCommandWithReply, HTTP     requests should now be valid HTTP requests.  This bug was carried      through from a Metrowerks bug and fixes many IIS5 connection issues.   - fixed status checking in CDAVRequest::DeleteResource to also include     200 and 207 as valid resonses for DELETE.   - was errantly setting content-type on MKCOL, updated method     CDAVRequest::CreateDirectory   - changed code that appends the Destination field to the HTTP header     to not fold the header anymore.  This fixes some MOVE and COPY issues with     MS IIS5   - Added code to handle the case where a server returns a status of 100 Continue.     DAVLib doesn't send an Expect: header, but there are cases in RRF 2068 (most     notably Post) where a server may elect to return a 100 to an HTTP 1.1 even if     the Expect header is absent.Version 1.6   - Resources are now properly URL encoded and decoded   - added support for If and Lock-Token HTTP Headers   - cleaned up Lock and Unlock HTTP code.   - added High level Lock and Unlock API calls to CDAVRequest   - added lock support to PUT   - added lock support to CreateCollection   - added new lock enabled version of CDAVRequest::DeleteResource   - added new function; CDAVRequest::GetResourceExists.Version 1.7   - added support for basic proxy authentication to CDAVMessage and CDAVContext   - added CDAVContext::equals   - added LListeners to all public APIs   - overrode SendData in CDAVConnection to fix a broadcast bug on the progress sending   	bytes on a send.   - added a cancellation function to CDAVRequest; only works for PutResource and GetResource   though.   - added a Depth parameter to ListDirectory   - upated Headers to include HeaderDoc comments   - assorted code changes to port to Carbon   - added CDAVRequest::SetItemProperty and CDAVRequest::RemoveItemProperty   - added CDAVItem::RemoveProperty   - fixed issue in CDAVRequest::ListDirectory (exposed by some required carbon changes      in XML parsing) where an item's HREF is truncated in some situations.  Chance of this     happening in MacOS Classic are very remote but possible; the noted carbon changes made      more prevalent on OSX/OS9-carbon   - added new CDAVTreeWalker classVersion 1.7.1   - fixed bug in ListDirectory where a NULL pointer access occured if a forbidden is     returned for the properties on a resource   - fixed bug in proxy authentication where the proxy user name was being sent 2x instead     of user name and passwordVersion 1.7.2   - fixed bug in CDAVRequest::ListDirectory and CDAVRequest::GetItemProperties where the     actual property data returned for an activelock was not being stored in the      CDAVItem.Version 1.8   - integrated patches from I-Drive; these implement integration with OpenSSL,     persistent connections, and a totally C String based API   - added an HTTP logging/tracing facility.  Version 1.8.1   - fixed bug in persistent connections in that the connection is not properly closed     when the server closes the connection unexpectedly.  Version 1.8.5   - integrated final bug fixes from i-Drive   - added support for HTTP redirection   - added DAVLib versioning functions   - added user agent for DAVLib   Version 1.9   - bumped version up to 1.9.0   - added Unicode transcoding utilities   - fixed URL encoding (compliments of some code from Neon)
   - added callbacks for SSL Certificate management and client certificate mgmt
   - fixed cookie handling to accept cookies on HTTP/401 and to provide the cookie
     list when copying a CDAVConnection in a session (fixes some NetWare issues)
