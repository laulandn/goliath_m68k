Goliath for MacOS - Change HistoryVersion 0.20    - Drag&Drop from Finder will import file   - updated view hierarchy; fixed problem where header didn't scroll with table view   - Goliath now checks to see if the server supports WebDAV upon the first access     of a resource   - 'Kind' column now displays mime type of non-collection resources.   - added an internal messaging system that is more robust and less prone to      crashes (ie, closing a window while a transaction is happening).  This new     architecture enables updating of displayed resources in windows other than where     the operation was performed   - implemented delete.   - fixed defect where Goliath would freeze when rendering large collections.   Version 0.30   - Added error dialog and error checking for improper XML in a DAV response.   - Drag&Drop of folders into a Goliath window works now; MKCOL is called for     folders and all contents of the folder are recursively POSTed to the server.   - Dragging out of Goliath to the Finder downloads the selected items.  Collections     are recursed and all of their contents are downloaded as well.  Dragging to the     Trash Can will download the selected items to the trash and then delete them from      the server.   - Added code to obtain actual Application/BNDL resource icons for files from the      Finder or Desktop Database.  The File creator and type is determined from Internet     Config.   - Connections can be saved and loaded.  Connection information is stored in XML form. Version 0.50   - added text to header specifying how many items are in the display   - columns are now resizeable   - added Lock/Unlock functionality   - added lockowner column   - when connections are saved, window size and position as well as column widths     are stored in the connection file and are restored upon reload   - new preferences dialog; added choice of startup behavior (prompt to open an      existing connecton, prompt for a new connection or do nothing).  New XML     based preferences file saved in the System or User (MacOS 9) preferences folder   - added a mechanism to allow users to specify URL parameters when downloading items     via HTTP GET from a WebServer. (Jim Harrison <jhrsn@pop.pitt.edu>)   - store column widths in connection document   - store window location in connection document   - added mechanism to store client obtained locks persistently   - cmd-delete to delete selected files [like finder] (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)   - added balloon help   Version 0.7   - added Duplicate function (similar to Finder)   - Started a Property Display/Edit dialog   - added type/select feature   - added a Window's menu.  Menu will track all open frames and dynamically     add menu items.  Also included are various window operations like stack     all windows, tile windows, etc.   - Drag&Drop from Finder will now track the drag and if dropped over a      folder, the selected folder will be the target of the drop operation      and not the resource displayed in the frame.   - many operations are now sensitive to current selection; similar to the Drag     &Drop case.  In the case of Duplication, Upload from Menu and New Folder, if      there is a single item selected that is a collection, the selected collection     is the target of the operation and not the resource specified by the root window.   - fixed bug in refresh where a folder that was expanded and collapsed would not be     removed on the refresh and would be duplicated in the new display.   - extended New Connection dialog to accept a user and password for a proxy server.       Integrated in changes made to DAVLib to support this functionality.  Added      proxy user and proxy password to connection docuents.  Moved proxy controls     to a hidden panel that is shown/expanded with a disclosure widget   - fixed bug where an apostrophe was not properly decoded in an URL   - added a central, per frame storage facility to maintain a list of all      properties to be retrieved as part of DAV transactions   - made folder expansion and window management more like the Finder; when an expanded     folder is double-clicked, a new window is created and the expanded original folder     is collapsed.  Likewise, if a collapsed folder is expanded, if there is a window     currently displaying that collection, that window is closed.   - implemented resource display singleton pattern; only one window per collection     resource is now allowed.  Repeatedly double-clicking on a folder in a window will     bring up the window that currently displays that item and will only create a new     window if no other window currently is displaying that collection.   - added a new dialog that will display all properties for a specified resource.   - progress UI in upload to and download from server is now finer grained; will count      total number of files to be processed, including those contained in nested folders      and include this number in the progress bar.  Also implemented cancel for single      item downloads.   - added UI to support mod_dav 1.0 executable propertyVersion 0.75   - integrated in latest DAVLib updates (C string API and SSL)   - more streamlining of New Connection dialog (Jim Whitehead)   - added a Goliath UserAgent field to outgoing requests   - MacBinary support for files with resources
