Extended Drag&Drop upload to recurse          folders.  Implemented  Drag&Drop download; folders are recursed          and dragging to Trash will download to Trash and then delete from          server.  Added the ability to save and load connections to and from         document files; this adds a primitive bookmarking capability.  Document         Icons now render their icons directly from the creating applications;          creator and type are determined from Internet Config file mappings.       ¥ 0.50 - March 28, 2000.  added text to header specifying how many items          are in the display.

Cmd-delete to delete selected files [like finder].         Balloon help for Menu items.  First cut at Lock/Unlock functionality.           Added Apple Help.       ¥ 0.7  - August 7, 2000.  New Duplicate function (similar to Finder),          Implemented a Property Display dialog.   Added type/select feature.            Added a Window's menu.  Menu will track all open frames and dynamically          add menu items.  Also included are various window operations like stack          all windows, tile windows, etc.  Drag&Drop from Finder will now track the         drag and if dropped over a  folder, the selected folder will be the target         of the drop operation and not the resource displayed in the frame.  Many          operations are now sensitive to current selection.  Fixed bug in refresh          where a folder that was expanded and collapsed would not be removed on the          refresh and would be duplicated in the new display.  Extended New Connection         dialog to accept a user and password for a proxy server.  Fixed bug where         an apostrophe was not properly decoded in an URL.  Made folder expansion and         window management more like the Finder; when an expanded folder is          double-clicked, a new window is created and the expanded original folder         is collapsed.  Likewise, if a collapsed folder is expanded, if there is a          window currently displaying that collection, that window is closed.  Implemented          resource display singleton pattern; only one window per collection resource          is now allowed.  Repeatedly  double-clicking on a folder in a window will          bring up the window that currently displays that item and will only create a          new window if no other window currently is displaying that collection.           Progress UI in upload to and download from server is now finer grained; will          count  total number of files to be processed, including those contained in          nested folders and include this number in the progress bar.  Also implemented          cancel for single item downloads.  Added UI to support mod_dav 1.0          executable property.

Fixed bug          preventing WebRFM from being used properly.         ¥ 0.82   -    November 23, 2001.  Fixed a proxy authentication bug where the proxy user                                 name  was being used as the password.       ¥ 0.9 - Added features to encode resource forks with the Apple Double encoding.         Fixed assorted UI bugs: date now sorts properly, cleaned up UI refresh, added         option to case-insensitive sort, Window menu operations will no longer resize         progress dialogs.
