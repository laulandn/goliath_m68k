/* *	CFM68K_GlobalDestructors.c	-	global destruction support for CodeWarriorª C/C++ (CFM68K) *									Cloned from the PPC runtime version * *	Copyright © 1995-1997 Metrowerks, Inc. All Rights Reserved. * * *	THEORY OF OPERATION * *	When the compiler generates code to call initializers for global variables and *	nonlocal static variables, it calls the function __register_global_object() to *	register the constructed object for destruction. * *	When the program exits, it calls __destroy_global_chain() to call destructors *	for the registered objects, in the reverse order of their construction. * *	For most applications, there is a single global destructor chain for the *	entire program, even if the program is composed of multiple fragments (shared libs) *	This is necessary to support the proper program termination sequence, wherein *	all destructors must be called before e.g. closing open files and cleaning up *	the console window. * *	"Drop-ins" which may load and unload as a program is running should each have *	their own global destructor chain which is created when the drop-in is loaded *	and destroyed when the drop-in is unloaded. * */#include <CPlusLib.h>#include <Exception68K.h>#include <NMWException.h>	/*	public data		*/DestructorChain *__global_destructor_chain;/************************************************************************//*	Purpose..: 	Register a global object for later destruction			*//*	Input....:	pointer to global object								*//*	Input....:	pointer to destructor function							*//*	Input....:	pointer to global registration structure				*//*	Return...:	pointer to global object (pass thru)					*//************************************************************************/extern void *__register_global_object(void *object,void *destructor,void *regmem){	((DestructorChain *)regmem)->next=__global_destructor_chain;	((DestructorChain *)regmem)->destructor=destructor;	((DestructorChain *)regmem)->object=object;	__global_destructor_chain=(DestructorChain *)regmem;	return object;}/************************************************************************//* Purpose..: Destroy all constructed global objects					*//* Input....: ---														*//* Return...: ---														*//************************************************************************/void __destroy_global_chain(void){	DestructorChain	*gdc;	while((gdc=__global_destructor_chain)!=0L)	{		__global_destructor_chain=gdc->next;		DTORCALL_COMPLETE(gdc->destructor,gdc->object);	}}
