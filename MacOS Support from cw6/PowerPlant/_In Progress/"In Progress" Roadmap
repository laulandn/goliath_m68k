========================================================================Roadmap for PowerPlant "In Progress" Classes========================================================================Version: PowerPlant 2.1	 (CW Pro 6)Date:    July 20, 2000========================================================================The "_In Progress" folder in the PowerPlant folder contains classesthat aren't ready for prime time. This document describes the currentstate of these classes, and the plans for their future.Please note that comments about future plans are NOT promises.It's what we plan to do, but priorities and development schedulesare subject to change.========================================================================Classes========================================================================Appearance Classes------------------Classes for implementing new controls introduced by Apple with theAppearance Manager in Mac OS 8 and later.Status:		Work reliably, but there may be cosmetic problems with			certain combinations of OS and Appearacne Manager versions.Future:		We will continue to update these classes to respond to			changes in the Appearance Manager.Constructor Additions---------------------Classes used internally in the Constructor view editorStatus:		Work reliablyFuture:		These classes will continue to evolve to suit our needs in			further developing Constructor.Contextual Menus----------------Classes for supporting contextual menusStatus:		Work OKFuture:		UncertainCore Foundation---------------Wrapper classes for Apple's Core Foundation APIStatus:		They work, but have not been tested much.Future:		Still undergoing development. API may change.Cursor Classes--------------Classes for handling color and animated cursors.Status:		They work, but have not been tested much.Future:		Still undergoing development. API may change.Debugging Classes-----------------Debugging utilitiesStatus:		Work OK		Future:		Still undergoing development. API may change.Graphics Utility Classes------------------------Drawing utilities used mostly by the Grayscale ClassesStatus:		Work ReliablyFuture:		Will move to regular distribution along with the Appearance			Classes.Grayscale Classes-----------------Classes used internally in Metrowerks tools (Constructor, IDE, Debugger, etc.)for user interface design.Status:		Work ReliablyFuture:		Will move to regular distribution in the futureMenu Utilities--------------Wrapper classes for the Menu Manager which support both the old andnew APIs. The Appearance Manager version 1.0 added a few new calls, andversion 1.1 in Mac OS 8.5 added more.Status:		They work, but have not been tested much.Future:		Still under development.Page Controller Classes-----------------------Classes for implementing the page tabs used in Constructor and the IDEStatus:		Work ReliablyFuture:		Will move to regular distribution in the future. API may			change slightly.StuffIt Classes---------------Classes for dealing with StuffIt archives. StuffIt is a compressionutility from Aladdin Systems.Status:		They work, but have not been tested much.Future:		Will move to regular distribution sometime in the future.Table Classes-------------Varieties of TablesStatus:		Mixed. Some work OK, others are a bit buggy and unfinished.Comment:	The "More Table Classes" were contributed by Andy Dent, who			does work on AppMaker (by Bowers Development). Thanks, Andy.			There's a new sample project in the PP Examples folder that			uses the More Table Classes.Future:		Development is continuing. APIs will change.
