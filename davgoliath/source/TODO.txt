To-Do
-----
- continue to enhance error messaging
- integrate a thread pool
- move &copy
- ok button enablement in new folder dlog
- redraw bug; on horizonal scroll, overhang region sometimes doesn't draw properly
- icon inside of frame if resource at root of frame is locked
- lock and unlock of resource at root of frame
- lock owner bug in lock details
- Digest Authentication
- Support NTLM authentication for MSProxy Server
- in-place edit of props that do a PROPPATCH
- display of arbitrary properties in main display
- get an "HTTP/1.1 Unauthorized" if a "—" is in the user name
- improve display of property names in props dlog; either put ellipses
  if truncated, or put in a namespace hierarchy (Jim Whitehead
  <ejw@ics.uci.edu>)
- I think it would be nice if the supported lock information were better
  formatted, instead of just displaying the XML. (Jim Whitehead  <ejw@ics.uci.edu>)
- It would be nice if you could have multiple property windows up
  simultaneously. (Jim Whitehead  <ejw@ics.uci.edu>)
- clicking cancel from download with options dialog box quits
  the application with type 2 error (laji@mail.com)
- email address in info panel is not selectable... should be for
  ease of copy/paste - may be OSX only (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
-  background of OK button in prefs panel is white, not grey like
	rest of window (though window's shouldn't be grey-- it should be the little
	horizontal lines, right?); OSX Only (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
- When accessing a server using basic authorization, it is possible
  that the authorization will become invalid below a certain level on that
  server.  Below that level, it may require a different username/password to
  access the contents.   Goliath correctly detects/displays the 401 response
  when the original username/pass are no longer valid, but it should ask for a
  new user/pass combination and use that user/pass combination anytime it runs
  into the new authorization realm.  (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
- Streaming ListDirectory (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
- Would be nice to have a ".." or "go to parent" feature on the window (Bill
  Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
- Need to be able to create NULL locks and locks other than
  exclusive [like being able to both create locks with timeouts and show the
  timeouts on existing locks] (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
- extend connection saving to not put in user name and password (Beth
  Rettenmund <bethr@mailcity.com>)
- encrypt user name and password in connection documents
- fix data transfer on PromiseHFS to create dummy files so that files are placed
  properly by the Finder
- fix end of upload prog bar reset 

Done
----   
- It would be nice if you could use the TAB key to go from the URL entry
  field to the password entry field in the new site dialog box.  I'd like to
  enter the URL, TAB, press space to activate basic auth, TAB, username, TAB,
  password, RETURN (Jim Whitehead  <ejw@ics.uci.edu>)
- rewrite HREF handling to use c-strings instead of Pascal strings (currently,
  when a URL tops out at 255 chars, Goliath, and DAVLib don't handle it properly)
- persistent HTTP connections
- integration w/ OpenSSL
- DAVLib trace functionality (Jim Whitehead  <ejw@ics.uci.edu>)

  <bbum@codefab.com>)
- fix display of DAV:supportedlock in props dlog (reported by Jim Whitehead) 
- drag&drop upload 
- fix main window resizing and scrolling issues 
- progress UI on upload
- drag-drop of many items at once - failures
- implement HTTP OPTIONS, add DAVLib API to determine if server supports DAV; integrate 
   checking into UI.
- integrate a cross window messaging scheme for data changes
- implement rename resources
- use resourcetype to determine CDAVItem type
- implement delete resources
- dbl-click to view href in browser
- on upload of new file, file name is truncated and Kind is not displayed properly
- clean up cancel in secondary dlogs
- Commander hierarchy fix when progress dlogs are hidden/closed
- crash if close window while txn occurring   
- finish window messaging scheme for data changes
- finish delete (prune redundant hrefs)

- ok button enablement in new connection dlog
- implement export resources
- pretty icons via InternetConfig
- bookmark storage/window

- GET items recursively
- compatibility with edocs-online & IIS5
- implement resizable headers
- put a 'number of items' field in the header
- store column widths in connection document
- store window location in connection document
- lock information dialog
- integreate locking into put, mkcol, etc.
- fixed a bug where in some cases, props weren't fetched on on MKCOL
- added a "No set lock owner" preference (temp fix for mydocsonline.com)
- bug - lock a folder and lock icon doesn't show up immediately
- integreate locking into mkcol (if immediate parent href is locked, send that lock).
- bug drag and dropping a folder name that already exists
- only enable Lock related actions if Server OPTIONS returns lock methods available
- send lock for parent on delete if parent is locked
- send lock for parent on PUT if parent is locked
- selection of items based on keystroke
- refresh bug; sometimes on refresh, one item hangs around as a ghost and is
  duplicated from the server.  Don't have solid reproduction sequence.
- verify new code for authentication for proxy servers
- implement window mgmt in a more finder like way (a collection can either
  be expanded in a window OR have it's own top level window, not both).
- display all properties for a given resource
- enhance progress for single large items and for folders

- error on file named 
  "backstreet boys-medley by dj deny victoriano and dj joseph.mp3"

  double click on the folder.  crash
- binhexing files with resource forks
- Preferences menu should be under the Goliath (Version 0.7) menu
  (the leftmost menu) on OSX (Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com>)
