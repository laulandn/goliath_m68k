Matthew D. Fassiotto                                     **	Purpose...:	this header is meant to include platform specific                 implementations of standard math functions according to                the target architecture as set by the metrowerks compiler.                NOTE: This header gets included automatically by math.h.  It is not a          standalone header meant to be included directly by any application.          We do not support any source file including this header directly.          This header depends on macros and other types defined in math.h          which must be defined before this header is inlcuded.  Therefore          you are guaranteed this will NOT compile when included directly.CHANGE HISTORY:000619 --  moved amd architecture header from cmath to this one.          */           #include <msl_t.h>extern float _inv_sqrtf(float x); /* implementation in sqrtf.c */#if __MIPS__#  include <math_mips.h>#elif __m56800__							        #  include <m56800_math.h> 			            	#elif __m56300__							        #  include <m56300_math.h> 	#elif __POWERPC__#  include <math_ppc.h>	#elif __INTEL__	#  include <math_x87.h>            	#if __option(k63d)# include <AMD_K63DNow_math.h>  #endif                                #endif						             					#endif
