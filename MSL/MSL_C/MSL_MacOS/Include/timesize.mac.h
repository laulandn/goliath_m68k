Defining __TIMESIZE_DOUBLE__ *  will cause clock_t to be redefined as a double, which redefines the clock function to be a *  double as well.  See time.h and time.mac.c for implementation details. * *  If you wish a higher resolution microsecond clock as defined by the MacOS operating system, *  enable __TIMESIZE_DOUBLE__ below by removing the comments surrounding it and ensure that *  all of your code using the clock routine understands the new type double. */ #ifndef __timesize_mac__#define __timesize_mac__/*#define __TIMESIZE_DOUBLE__  */#endif/*     Change record * 971222  vss  New file. */
